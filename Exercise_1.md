# Enhancing the Book and Novel Classes - Java Exercise

## Task 1: Add a Constructor to Book Class
- **Create a constructor** in the `Book` class that initializes the `title`, `author`, and `pages` attributes.
- Use this constructor in the `Main` class to create a `Book` object.

## Task 2: Add a Copy Constructor to Novel Class
- **Implement a copy constructor** in the `Novel` class that takes another `Novel` object and initializes a new one with the same values.
- Test this constructor in the `Main` class by creating a copy of an existing `Novel` object.

## Task 3: Overriding a Method
- **Override the `displayInfo()` method** in the `Novel` class to include the genre of the novel.
- Call this method from the `Main` class to display the novel's information.

## Task 4: Adding a Static Method
- **Add a static method** in the `Book` class, named `comparePages`, that takes two `Book` objects and returns the one with more pages.
- Test this method in the `Main` class with different `Book` and `Novel` objects.

## Bonus Task: Adding Exception Handling
- In the setters for `pages`, add a check to ensure the number of pages is positive. If not, throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.
- Modify the `Main` class to handle this exception.

### Instructions for Implementation
- For each task, start by modifying the existing classes or creating new ones as required.
- After implementing a feature, test it in the `Main` class to ensure it works as expected.
- Handle any errors or exceptions gracefully.
- Comment your code to explain your logic and changes.

**Note:** This exercise will give you hands-on experience with constructors, method overriding, static methods, and basic exception handling in Java. It will also help you understand the concept of inheritance and how child classes can extend the functionality of parent classes.
